Project planning is one of the major steps to deciding on a team and executing the project in an efficient way. We will use 'Aims grid' for our project planning. 

Aims grid: It is a project management tool and it has four components. Purpose, Team Selection, End Result, and Success Criteria. 

1. Purpose: To unlock sales insights that are not visible before to the sales team for decision support and automate them to reduce manual time spent in data gathering.

2. Team Selection: Sales Director, Marketing Team, Customer Service Team, Data and Analytics Team, and IT. 

3. End Result: An automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights in order to support data-driven decision-making. 

4. Success Criteria:
   
   a) Dashboard uncovering sales order insights with the latest data 
	available.

   b) Sales team able to make better decisions and prove 10% cost savings of total spend. 

   c) Sales Analysis stop data gathering manually in order to save 20%
	of their business time and reinvest it in value-added activity.
